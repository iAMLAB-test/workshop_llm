      "In pursuing our dream and vision, CGI has been highly disciplined throughout its history in executing a Build and Buy profitable\n",
      "growth strategy comprised of four pillars that combine profitable organic growth (Build) and accretive acquisitions (Buy):\n",
      "\n",
      "Pillar 1: Win, renew and extend contracts\n",

      "\n",
      "These first two pillars relate to driving profitable organic growth through the pursuit of contracts with new and existing clients in\n",
      "our targeted industries. As such, CGI engages with new and existing clients on four levers in our portfolio of end-to-end\n",
      "services and solutions: Business and Strategic IT Consulting, Systems Integration, Managed Services and IP-based services.\n",
      "Successes in these pillars reflect the strength of our end-to-end portfolio of capabilities, the depth of expertise of our\n",

      "clients, both existing and potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pillar 3: Metro market acquisitions\n",
      "\n",
      "Pillar 4: Large, transformational acquisitions\n",
      "\n",
      "The third and fourth pillars focus on growth through accretive acquisitions. The third pillar for metro market acquisitions\n",
      "complements the proximity model and helps to provide a fuller range of end-to-end services. The fourth pillar for large\n",
      "transformational acquisitions helps to further expand our geographic footprint and reach the critical mass required to compete\n",
      "for large managed IT and business process services contracts and broaden our client relationships. Both the third and fourth\n",
      "pillars are supported by three levers. First, is our range of end-to-end services that allow us to consider a broad range of\n",
      "acquisitions. A second lever is CGI's industry sector mix that helps us mirror the IT spend of each metro market over time. A\n",
      "final lever across pillars three and four focuses on IP-based services firms that offer consulting services and managed services\n",
      "that leverage their solutions.\n",
      "CGI will continue to be a consolidator in the IT and business consulting services industry by being active across these four\n",
      "pillars.\n",

      "Executing our strategy\n",
      "\n",

      "clients benefit from our unique combination of industry domain and technology expertise within our global delivery\n",
      "model.\n",
      "• Committed experts: Two of our key strategic goals are to be our clients’ partner and expert of choice. To achieve\n",
      "this, we invest in developing and recruiting professionals with extensive industry, business and in-demand technology\n",
      "expertise. Individually and collectively, each of our experts embody partnership behaviors in all they do by being\n",
      "consultative and building trusted relationships with each other, our clients, shareholders, and within our communities.\n",
      "In addition, a majority of consultants and professionals are also owners through our Share Purchase Plan, which,\n",
      "combined with the Profit Participation Plan, provide an added level of commitment to the success of our clients.\n",
      "• Everyday innovation: Our approach to client engagements is to continuously bring forward actionable insights that\n",
      "support clients’ ROI-led digitization priorities. Through our client satisfaction program, we regularly assess the degree\n",
      "to which clients find that CGI introduced applicable innovation to the engagements we deliver for them, including\n",

      "CGI’s competition is comprised of a variety of firms, from local companies providing specialized services and software,\n",
      "government pure-plays to global business consulting and IT services providers. All of these players are competing to deliver\n",
      "some or all of the services we provide.\n",
      " Many factors distinguish the industry leaders, including the following:\n",
